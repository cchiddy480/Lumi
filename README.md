# Lumi - Interactive Visual Programming Environment

Lumi is an open-source, visual programming environment designed to make learning to code fun, interactive, and intuitive for kids and teenagers. With Lumi, students can create programs by dragging and dropping visual elements—enabling creativity, experimentation, and an entirely new way of engaging with code.

## Vision
Lumi aims to break down the barriers of traditional text-based coding, offering an engaging, visual experience that mimics how kids interact with the world. By connecting symbols, dragging intuitive elements, and watching them interact, students can learn to code without fear or frustration, fostering a creative environment where they can explore programming concepts like building blocks.

## Key Features
- **Drag-and-Drop UI Builder**: Create programs by dragging components like variables, buttons, actions, and more into a visual canvas.
- **Two-Way Interaction**: Changes made in the visual editor are reflected in real-time code, and vice versa. This gives learners a hands-on experience with how code and visuals relate to one another.
- **Simple and Engaging Interface**: Lumi’s playful, colorful interface is designed with kids in mind, making coding approachable and fun.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual connections are represented in real-time, allowing users to see the effects of their actions instantly, encouraging imagination and exploration.
- **Code Generation**: As students create with the visual editor, Lumi automatically generates Python code, offering a clear understanding of the relationship between the UI and underlying logic.
- **Gamified Learning**: Progress through levels, earn badges, and unlock new elements to keep motivation high.

## Getting Started
### Installation
To install Lumi, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Lumi.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Lumi Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Lumi
   ```
3. **Install Requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run Lumi**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

Lumi runs on Python and uses PyQt5 for the graphical interface. It is cross-platform and should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Using Lumi
- **Toolbox and Canvas**: The toolbox contains different visual components like variables, actions, and control flows. Drag these elements into the canvas to start building your program.
- **Connecting Elements**: Click on elements to connect them, creating logical flows between actions and variables.
- **Code Viewer**: As you build visually, Lumi generates Python code that you can view and edit. This two-way sync helps to understand the relationship between the visuals and the code.

## Example Projects
- **Hello World**: Drag a button to the canvas, set its action to "print 'Hello World'", and watch the magic happen!
- **Guess the Number Game**: Create a simple game where the computer picks a number, and the player has to guess it.
- **Interactive Story**: Build an interactive story where different decisions lead to different outcomes.
